PIVOT and UNPIVOT: 
Aggregate functions return a single result row based on group of rows rather than a single row 


Some types of Grow Row Functions: 
1) Group functions 
2) Analytical functionss.

pivot turns a row into a column and can do a count. 

SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT deptno, empno,FROM empno
) 
PIVOT (COUNT(empno)
FOR (deptno) IN ('10' AS dept10, '20' AS dept20, '30' AS dept30));

ex: 

count number of employees in each dept, ie) dept 10 , 20 , 30: 

SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT deptno, empno
FROM emp
) 
PIVOT (COUNT(empno)
FOR (deptno) IN ('10' AS dept10, '20' AS dept20, '30' AS dept30));

output: 

  DEPT10     DEPT20     DEPT30
---------- ---------- ----------
         3          5          6
		 
-- this time the instructor does the same but uses count()

SELECT * FROM emp
SELECT deptno, count(*) no_of_emp FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno

-- dont work try this: 

SELECT * FROM 
(
SELECT deptno, empno FROM emp
)
PIVOT (COUNT(empno) FOR (deptno) IN ('10' AS dept10,'20' AS dept20,'30' AS dept30))  < -- displays as column names 

output: 
 DEPT10     DEPT20     DEPT30
---------- ---------- ----------
         3          5          6
		 
		 
-- try jobs ... add job and count of each job position:

SELECT * FROM emp
(
SELECT job, empno FROM emp)
PIVOT (COUNT(empno) FOR (job) IN ('CLERK' AS clerk, 'MANAGER' AS MANAGER,'ANALYST' AS analyst,'SALESMAN' AS salesman,'PRESIDENT' AS president))

 CLERK    MANAGER    ANALYST   SALESMAN  PRESIDENT
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
         4          3          2          4          1
		 
-- create table called pilot test - unpivot dem 

CREATE TABLE unpivot_test
AS
SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT job, empno FROM emp) 
PIVOT (COUNT(empno) FOR (job) IN ('CLERK' AS clerk, 'MANAGER' AS MANAGER,'ANALYST' AS analyst,'SALESMAN' AS salesman,'PRESIDENT' AS president))
