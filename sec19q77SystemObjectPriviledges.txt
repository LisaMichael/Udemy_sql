Still having a problem creating my test user scott . 

Here is the error I receive: 

Oracle provides a script since the very early releases to create the scott schema. The script is called “scott.sql” and is located under $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin.

Error starting at line : 24 in command -
GRANT CONNECT,RESOURCE,UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO SCOTT IDENTIFIED BY TIGER
Error report -

CREATE CREATE TABLE to user1;    < --- system priviledge 

Grant succeeded; 

GRANT SELECT on EMP to user1;   <<< -- giving an object name, so it is called object priviedge  
Grant succeeded 


conn user1/user1
Connected 

SELECT * FROM user_tab_privs; 

this displays object names 

to view system priviledges: 

SELECT * FROM user_tab_privs;  

its about the object type 



system priviledge                              object priviedge
