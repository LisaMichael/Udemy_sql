INSERT INTO scott.loc values (1 'test loc'); 

ERROR at line 1: 
INSUFFICIENT PRIVILEDGES 


LETS add ito emp table 

INSERT INTO scott.emp (empno, ename, deptno) VALUES (1002, 'Test1002',10); 

1 row created

CANNOT INSERT INTO DEPT table.

Can insert into scott.l 

IN REAL LIFE IT IS NOT IDEAL TO GRANT ROLES TO INDIVIDUAL USERS, BUT GRANT THEM IN GROUPS
